# redux-task-manager

An app to help to manage tasks: adds, deletes and filters tasks, 
displayes active and completed status. 

To create this app I used vanilla Redux in order to gain 
good understanding of global state management flow and 
how Redux concepts like store, reducers, actions and immutability
work "under the hood".
